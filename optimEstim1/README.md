# Optimistic Estimation Experiment

## Overview

This experiment explores the "Optimistic Estimation" theory framework to investigate the generalization puzzle in deep learning. The optimistic estimation theory provides a novel approach to estimate the minimum sample size required for training neural networks to recover target functions (achieving zero generalization error).

## Theoretical Background

The optimistic estimation theory is based on three core principles:

1. **Optimistic Initialization**: Consider model performance under optimal conditions by initializing parameters near ideal points
2. **Linear Approximation**: Perform linear approximation of the model around the ideal point
3. **Sample Complexity Derivation**: Derive the minimum sample size required to recover the target function based on linear approximation

## Experiment Objectives

This experiment aims to verify the applicability of optimistic estimation theory across different machine learning models:

1. **Matrix Factorization (5×5)**: Verify that simple regression and matrix factorization models can achieve optimistic sample complexity under proper parameter tuning
2. **Matrix Completion Position Analysis**: Explore how the specific position distribution of observed data affects sample complexity in matrix completion tasks
3. **Neural Network Complexity**: Verify that more complex neural network models require sample sizes that approach but do not fall below the optimistic sample complexity

## 实验结果

实验已成功完成，结果表明乐观估计理论在所有三个实验场景中都得到了验证：

1. **矩阵分解**：验证了在适当初始化下，样本复杂度接近理论预测的乐观边界
2. **矩阵补全**：证明了观测位置分布对样本复杂度有显著影响，随机策略通常表现最佳
3. **神经网络**：确认了更复杂的神经网络模型需要的样本量接近但不低于乐观样本复杂度
